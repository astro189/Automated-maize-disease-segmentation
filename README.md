# Leaf-disease-segmentation-using-vegetation-indexes-and-image-processing
A robust implementation of combining vegetation indexes with advanced image processing techniques to segment affected areas of maize leaves

<h3>What are vegetation indexes?</h3>

<p>A vegetation index (VI) is a spectral imaging transformation of two or more image bands designed to enhance the contribution of vegetation properties and allow reliable spatial and temporal inter-comparisons of terrestrial photosynthetic activity and canopy structural variations.</p>
